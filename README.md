Spectra Search SPD Database 

Project by: Bandr Alswyan, Ryan Chu, Thomas Horgan & Sheng Kai Liao  
 
Abstract:

Client: Department of Energy Building Technologies Office

Need: a searchable database of spectral power distributions (SPD) from commercial LEDs that
has the ability to derive lighting qualities (TM30, CRI, color temperature, etc.) directly from the
SPD and the ability to export the data unlike private sector firms and general energy companies
or Databases technology firms who might charge too much for such a product. The product
should undergo user testing to ensure import/export capabilities as well as correct and accurate
SPD calculations.

Solution: Spectrasearch SPD database product is a searchable database for which the customer
can access data and analytical information regarding lighting mechanism sources and filter them
accordingly.
